This README was created using cat <<EOF from the CLI. 
It allows multi-line text files to be created from the CLI without needing to enter a file.
At the bottom of this file it is important to add the EOF tag 
This extra part was testing the >> function in "cat <<EOF >> filename
to see if new text would be appended to the existing text or overwrite it.
